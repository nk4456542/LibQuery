# LibQuery
Local Library to learn Django

The tutorial followthrough of [MDN's django tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django)

It is deployed here: [libQuery](https://peaceful-sierra-60610.herokuapp.com/)

I will change the UI soon to make this materialize and deploy it to a new site
